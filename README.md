# GBA-Breakout
Rough Atari Breakout clone for the Gameboy Advance.

This is an extremely messy, sloppily put together piece of software as it is my first attempt at a GBA project. I don't recommend using it as a learning resource or something to make your own games on top of.

Controls:

Left and Right to move the paddle. Up to let go of the ball. Hold the A Button to move faster.
